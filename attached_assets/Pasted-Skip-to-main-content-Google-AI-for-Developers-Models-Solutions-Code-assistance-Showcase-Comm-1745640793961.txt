Model version name patterns
Gemini models are available in either preview, stable, or experimental versions. In your code, you can use one of the following model name formats to specify which model and version you want to use.

Latest stable: Points to the most recent stable version released for the specified model generation and variation.

To specify the latest stable version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>. For example, gemini-2.0-flash.

Stable: Points to a specific stable model. Stable models usually don't change. Most production apps should use a specific stable model.

To specify a stable version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-2.0-flash-001.

Preview: Points to a preview model which may not be suitable for production use, come with more restrictive rate limits, but may have billing enabled.

To specify a preview version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25.

Experimental: Points to an experimental model which may not be suitable for production use and come with more restrictive rate limits. We release experimental models to gather feedback and get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly.

To specify an experimental version, use the following pattern: <model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>. For example, gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05.

Experimental models
In addition to stable models, the Gemini API offers experimental models which may not be suitable for production use and come with more restrictive rate limits.

We release experimental models to gather feedback, get our latest updates into the hands of developers quickly, and highlight the pace of innovation happening at Google. What we learn from experimental launches informs how we release models more widely. An experimental model can be swapped for another without prior notice. We don't guarantee that an experimental model will become a stable model in the future.

Previous experimental models
As new versions or stable releases become available, we remove and replace experimental models. You can find the previous experimental models we released in the following section along with the replacement version:
